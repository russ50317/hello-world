# hello-world
This is my first repository on here.
My name is Russell Bert Waters.
I am an author of Science Fiction and Horror stories.
I also do some acting.
I live in Des Moines, Iowa.
I like to learn things, and this is something new I've chosen to learn.
If you're reading this, and maybe you're feeling sad, lonely, or like your life is pointless, please stick around.
Tomorrow may not be better, either.
But the day after tomorrow might be just amazing.
You'll never know if you end things.
I don't know you, but I care about you.
There are lots of people who are like me out there.
That means, there are lots of people who care about you.
You're important.
You are loved.
Stick around :-)
